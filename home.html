                The international standard dry port is located 6 km away from Nepal-China border and is spread across 4.2 hectare.
                With the border point soon opening, people who had left the area are slowly returning. The infrastructure which was damaged by the earthquake is being built in a safer and better way.
                The Department of Customs has also started to send officials to work at the Customs Office at the border point. “We’ll be sending around 9 officials to work there for now,” adds Basnet [ ONLINE KHABAR, May 10th, Friday, 2019 1:00 PM]

                	>Australian media have reported concerns about the lowering standard of Australian universities as they shifted their focus to Nepali and Indian students.</div>As the number of Chinese students is flattening, the universities are filling the revenue gaps by attracting more Nepali and Indian students, who generally have lower standard, including that of English language, than average international students, according to media reports.“In 2017–18, one in every 1500 inhabitants of Nepal emigrated to Australia,” ABC reports, “In an era of strict immigration controls, that is an astonishing number for two countries so far apart, with no common language, heritage or ethnicity.”ABC adds, “Deregulation has allowed universities to selectively lower their standards to bring in more fee-paying foreign students, even when they fail to meet the thresholds for English language skills or academic achievement. And put under financial pressure by the Commonwealth’s funding cuts, some universities have done so.”Some of the universities have also begun opening colleges exclusively dedicated to overseas students.

                	>Samsung to acquire US cloud service firm to boost software</div>Samsung Electronics has agreed to buy a U.S. cloud service startup to boost its software and internet services. The South Korean company said Thursday that its acquisition of Joyent Inc. will enable Samsung to access its own cloud platform to run its internet-based services, apart from renting other companies' data centers. The company did not disclose financial terms.The move will likely accelerate Samsung's push to develop services that rely on external computing power for quick and large-scale data analysis.
                    Software has been a traditional weakness for Samsung, one of the largest tech hardware manufacturers and the world's top supplier of smartphones, television sets and memory chips. The Korean company opened its Global Innovation Center in Silicon Valley in 2013 to help fortify its software and services.[ REPUBLICA, May 10th, Friday, 2019 1:00 PM]
